Description: Multivariate tool for analyzing Genome-Wide Association
    Study (GWAS) results in the form of summary statistics. The goal
    of bmass is to comprehensively test all possible multivariate
    models given the phenotypes and datasets provided. Multivariate
    models are determined by assigning each phenotype to being either
    Unassociated (U), Directly associated (D) or Indirectly associated
    (I) with the SNP of interest. Test results for each model are
    presented in the form of Bayes factors, thereby allowing direct
    comparison between models.
