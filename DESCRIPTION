Description: Bayesian multivariate analysis of summary statistics (bmass) is a
    multivariate tool for analyzing Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
    results in the form of summary statistics. The goal of bmass is to
    comprehensively test all possible multivariate models given the phenotypes
    & datasets provided to bmass. Multivariate models are determined by
    assigning each phenotype to being either Unassociated (U), Directly
    associated (D) or Indirectly associated (I) with the SNP of interest. Test
    results for each model are presented in the form of Bayes factors, thereby
    allowing direct comparison between models.
