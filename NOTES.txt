notes
=====

+ Please do: Fill out README. We have lots of good examples of this from
  the Stephens lab; to start, see README in stephenslab/mixsqp repository.

+ Suggestion: Make sure roxygen2 docs are properly formatted (e.g., R
  code should be inside \code{}). See mixsqp.R inside the
  stephenslab/mixsqp repository for an example.

+ Please fix: Add an inst/CITATION file; see
  github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp for an example.

+ Suggestion: Create a "release" on GitHub. (I can show you how.)

+ Suggestion: Create a pkgdown site, and activate GitHub Pages (see
  https://github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp for an example of this). This
  is easy to do once you have create the vignettes and roxygen2 docs
  for your R functions.
