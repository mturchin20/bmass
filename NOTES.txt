notes
=====

Working On + Please do: Fill out README. We have lots of good examples of this from
  the Stephens lab; to start, see README in stephenslab/mixsqp repository.

+ Please do: Make sure roxygen2 docs are properly formatted (e.g., R
  code should be inside \code{}, and math should be inside \eqn{} or
  \deqn{}). Likewise, you could use \link{} whenever docs mention
  other functions. See mixsqp.R inside the stephenslab/mixsqp
  repository for an example.

FINISHED + Please do: Add an inst/CITATION file; see
  github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp for an example.

Working On + Suggestion: Create a "release" on GitHub. (I can show you how.)

Working On + Suggestion: Create a pkgdown site, and activate GitHub Pages (see
  https://github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp for an example of this). This
  is easy to do once you have create the vignettes and roxygen2 docs
  for your R functions.

Working On + Suggestion: Fix up vignette so that rendering/"knitting" the
  document will run the R code.

+ Suggestion: Likewise, it would be helpful if some of the examples
  where not inside "dontrun" so that we know that they actually run!

Working On + Please Do: 1. Fill out the README with basic details about the package. See for example:
  https://github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp
  https://github.com/stephenslab/smashr

+ Please Do: 2. Make sure roxygen2 docs are properly formatted, particularly code &
  equations.

Working on + Please Do: 3. Make the vignette and examples all runable---which is a great way to have
  tests "for free"!  In particular, it would be great if you could create a
  vignette that allows someone to "jump right in" to learning about bmass
  without having to follow all these tedious preprocessing steps. The vignette
  doesn't need to be long (I would say a short intro is best).
