notes
=====

+ Please do: Fill out README. We have lots of good examples of this from
  the Stephens lab; to start, see README in stephenslab/mixsqp repository.

+ Please do: Make sure roxygen2 docs are properly formatted (e.g., R
  code should be inside \code{}, and math should be inside \eqn{} or
  \deqn{}). Likewise, you could use \link{} whenever docs mention
  other functions. See mixsqp.R inside the stephenslab/mixsqp
  repository for an example.

+ Please do: Add an inst/CITATION file; see
  github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp for an example.

+ Suggestion: Create a "release" on GitHub. (I can show you how.)

+ Suggestion: Create a pkgdown site, and activate GitHub Pages (see
  https://github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp for an example of this). This
  is easy to do once you have create the vignettes and roxygen2 docs
  for your R functions.

+ Suggestion: Fix up vignette so that rendering/"knitting" the
  document will run the R code.

+ Suggestion: Likewise, it would be helpful if some of the examples
  where not inside "dontrun" so that we know that they actually run!
